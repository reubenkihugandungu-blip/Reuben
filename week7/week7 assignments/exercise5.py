# Trade Application — Construction Project Risk Assessment
# A contractor wants to predict whether a project will finish on time based on crew size, days remaining, and tasks left.
#  Write the prediction logic and run it against three active projects.

def predict_delivery_risk(crew_size, days_remaining, tasks_left):
    # efficiency: tasks per worker per day needed
    efficiency = tasks_left / (crew_size * days_remaining)
    if efficiency > 1.5:
        return "High risk: not enough time or crew"
    elif efficiency > 0.8:
        return "Medium risk: tight but possible"
    else:
        return "Low risk: on track"
