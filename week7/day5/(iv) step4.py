# Full Application with Batch Output and Summary
# The complete application processes multiple days in a batch, prints a formatted coaching report for each day,
#  then prints an overall summary: hit rate, average confidence, and the input difference between hit and miss days.

# Concept: Batch processing
# Running the same function on a list of inputs and collecting all results before printing.
#  You do not print inside the processing loop. You collect, then report. 
# This is how production applications are structured.
